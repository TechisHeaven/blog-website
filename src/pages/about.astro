		👋 Hey there! I&apos;m Himanshu, a Full Stack Web Developer who has been building the web for 2+ years, sharpening my skills in the ever-evolving tech world. It&apos;s been a wild ride from “Hello World” to “How did this bug get here?”
	</p>
	<p>
		 I&apos;m based in New Delhi, India, and my stack? Full of Next.js, React, Node.js and a sprinkle of Rust and Solidity (because why not complicate things for fun?).
	</p>
	<p>
		📚 Also, trying to survive being a BCA student while my code survives my caffeine habits.
	</p>
	<p>
		🧑‍💻 If you need help breaking (or fixing) the internet, you can ping me at <a href={`mailto:${MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS}`}>{MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS}</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		PS: I break it only to make it better, I promise!
	</p>
